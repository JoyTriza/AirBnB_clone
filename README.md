PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

DESCIPTION OF THE COMMAND INTERPRETOR

The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

Some of the commands available are:
 show
